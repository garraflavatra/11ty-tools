# 11ty-tools

This package provides an advanced asset pipeline for [Eleventy], the simpler static site generator.

JavaScript ([ECMAScript] is supported) and [Sass]/SCSS assets will be compiled using [webpack], a static module bundler for the web. This plugin also configures [11ty-image] to optimize internal and external images. Furthermore, it minimizes Eleventy's HTML output using [html-minifier].

## Installation

The easiest way to use this plugin, is by using my preconfigured [11ty-template]. If you want to install it yourself, you should do something like this:

```shell
npm install 11ty-tools --save-dev
```

```js
// .eleventy.js
const tools = require("11ty-tools");

module.exports = function (eleventyConfig) {
  eleventyConfig.addPlugin(tools);
  //...
};
```

```js
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = require("11ty-tools/lib/webpack-config");
```

## Features

### Asset processing

#### JavaScript/ECMAScript

Any valid JavaScript file put in `src/assets/js/*.js` will get processed and put in the asset manifest. Files in subdirectories will _not_ get processed, unless they're imported by a file matching the pattern above.

#### Sass/SCSS

Any valid Sass or SCSS file that is imported in `src/assets/style/bundle.js` will get processed and put in the asset manifest.

#### How to use assets

There are two ways to using assets.

You could get the absolute path to your asset by using the `{% asset 'name' %}` shortcode and feeding it with the asset name (e.g. `interactive.js` or `mystyles.css`). The relative path will be resolved from the asset manifest (living in `out/_proc/manifest.json`) generated by the [webpack-assets-manifest] plugin.

However, sometimes it is useful to inline an asset right in your HTML. You could do that by using `{% inlineasset 'name' %}`. The raw asset contents will be read from the file and returned by the shortcode. Make sure that you put `<style>` `</style>` or script tags around the shortcode, as it won't automatically do that for you.

### Images

You can have your images processed by using the `{% image 'path'[, 'alt'[, 'sizes']] %}` shortcode. Parameters:

- `path` **(required)**: The path to the image. Can be internal (e.g. `img/cat.png`) or external (e.g. `https://somesite.io/image.jpeg`).
- `alt` **(recommended)**: Alt text for screen readers.
- `sizes`: see [`sizes`] on MDN HTML documentation.

Any type of contribution is very welcome! Provisionally, I'm not going to put a lot of effort into contribution guidelines as this isn't a huge project.
